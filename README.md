# Weather Webcam Sonification
## - Creating Music Videos from weather data -

## 🚀 Motivation

Weather data is often represented in purely numerical or visual formats. However, by combining multiple sensory modalities—such as visualization, real-world webcam imagery, and sound—we can create a richer, more immersive experience.

This project explores how **sonification** and **animation** can bring weather data to life, making it more intuitive, engaging, and accessible:

- 🌌 **Webcam imagery** shows what the weather really looks like, beyond just charts.
- 📈 **Scientific line plots** visualize the meteorological data using clear and accurate graphs.
- 🎵 **Sound (sonification)** maps weather parameters (like temperature or pressure) to musical elements.
- 🌇 Combining all three modalities creates a unique, multi-sensory story of the weather.

## 📃 Project Overview

This project downloads **weather station data** and **webcam images** from the **Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)**. It then visualizes and sonifies this data, merging it into a compelling multimedia experience.

### Features

- 📷 Download webcam images from DWD.
- 🌌 Fetch weather station data (temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.).
- 🎨 Visualize webcam and station data in an animated plot.
- 🎶 Sonify weather data by generating a MIDI file.
- 🎧 Convert MIDI to WAV (currently very basic conversion method, improvements need to be implemented with packages like fluidsynth).
- 🎥 Combine animation and audio into an MP4 video.

## 🚀 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies. 
We recommend using uv (https://pypi.org/project/uv/) to easily set up the project via `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
pip install uv
cd music_video_from_weather
uv sync
```
ffmpeg is required but does not need to be installed separately: the `imageio-ffmpeg`
dependency bundles a prebuilt ffmpeg binary for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

All packages and dependencies should be resolved now. If not simply add the required package using

```bash
uv add package_name
```

## 📚 Usage

Set options inside `main.py`:

### Required:

- `station_id`: Weather station ID ([see available IDs](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/10_minutes/air_temperature/historical/zehn_min_tu_Beschreibung_Stationen.txt))
- `station`: Webcam station ID ([see available webcams](https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/webcam/))

> Note: You can combine a webcam station with any weather station, e.g. for the webcam 'Offenbach-W', you can use station '01420' (Frankfurt airport), '01424' (Frankfurt Campus Westend) or '07341' (Offenbach Wetterpark).

### Modes

#### **🕚 'now' mode**

- Downloads **live** weather and webcam data.
- Webcam data is only available for the **past 2 days**.
- Generates an animation of the last \~48 hours.

#### **📅 'historic' mode**

- Uses pre-downloaded webcam data stored in:
  ```
  weatherdata/{STATION_NUMBER}_historic/webcam_data/
  ```
- Example dataset included: Offenbach-O & Offenbach-W (2025-03-01 09:30 to 2025-03-07 14:00).

### Instruments

Choose the instruments you want for the different tracks: Melody, Bass, Harmony, Drums, Rain Sounds
> Here is a list with all the available instruments: ![Midi Instruments]([https://www.ccarh.org/courses/253/handout/gminstruments](https://fmslogo.sourceforge.io/manual/midi-instrument.html))

### Execution

To run the script, go to the Terminal and make sure you are in the same directory as the main.py file.
Now run this in you Terminal if you are using uv
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

## 🎶 Sonification Logic

Weather parameters are mapped to musical features using rules designed to convey both **emotion** and **data meaning**. The MIDI file contains 5 tracks:

| Track | Weather Feature   | Mapping Logic                                                                 |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | **Main Melody**   | Temperature → pitch (based on seasonal scale), wind speed → velocity, pressure gradient → duration |
| 1     | **Bass**       | Derived from melody (lower pitch); plays short/long notes based on pressure trend |
| 2     | **Harmony**        | Seasonal chord progressions (I–IV–V–IV); transposed based on pressure gradient |
| 3     | **Drums**          | Temperature (lower octave); volume modified by pressure (low = louder)       |
| 4     | **Rain Sounds**   | Rain intensity → velocity of rhythmic notes                                  |

### 🎺 Notes & Instruments

- **Four Seasons** by Vivaldi determines the scale of each season
- **Temperature** determines the melody notes (mapped to seasonally appropriate musical scales).
- **Wind speed** controls the note **velocity** (volume), from soft breezes to strong gusts.
- **Pressure changes** affect rhythm:
  - Rising pressure → short energetic notes
  - Falling pressure → slower, heavier notes
- **Chords** reflect the current season’s harmonic palette (e.g., major for spring/summer, minor for autumn/winter).
- **Bass** notes reinforce low-frequency textures, with volume increasing during low-pressure (stormy) conditions.
- **Rain** is mapped to soft or strong percussive note-like effects, based on real intensity (0–5 scale).


- MIDI is converted to WAV using a basic synth or a GUI tool like [Signal](https://signal.vercel.app/)

## 💚 How to Use

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Set options in `main.py`
4. Run the main script
5. Your output is in the final_output folder

(If you want to use another synthesizer, you can find the midi file in the assets folder. There you also have the video without sound.)

## ❌ Current Limitations

- MIDI-to-WAV conversion method is basic
  - Ideally use `fluidsynth` or other external synth for better quality, but this is not yet implemented
  - You can inspect or remix the MIDI file properly using tools like: [https://signal.vercel.app/](https://signal.vercel.app/)
- Webcam images only available from DWD for the past 2 days
  - No historic webcam dataset can be provided in this repo
- Limited set of webcam locations
